# MovieTime #

Welcome to MovieTime! Make your personal list of movies you want to see, arranged by length.

This project uses the Java Swing framework to make the GUI, Maven for dependencies, and JSoup to get html text from google searches.

# Installation Instructions #

All you have to do is add JSoup to Maven by adding to your Maven pom.xml file:

# How to Use #

To add movies, just type in the name in the top box and and hit Add! Nine times out of ten, the movie will be added with its correct time to the list on the right.

Once in a while, you’ll have to add movie lengths manually. Do this by entering the movie text and clicking “movie info” to take you to google. From there, do what you have to do to find the actual movie length. Make sure to enter the number of minutes eg. 100 not 1:40.

To remove a movie, type it in the movie name section or copy and paste the title from the list. Don’t worry about the length section. Also, be careful when removing all movies. This can’t be undone!

Click on “Random Movie” if you have no idea what you want to watch (which is me 99% of the time). 

Don't worry if you forget how to spell the movie name exactly or don't remember if there is a "the" in the beginning. Enjoy! I'll show all the features of the program below.
